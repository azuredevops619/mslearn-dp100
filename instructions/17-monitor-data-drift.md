# Monitor Data Drift

Changing trends in data over time can reduce the accuracy of the predictions made by a model. Monitoring for this *data drift* and retraining as necessary is an important way to ensure your machine learning solution continues to predict accurately.

## Before you start

Create aml workspace [here](https://github.com/azuredevops619/mslearn-dp100/blob/main/aml-setup.md) 

## Clone the lab materials

You can use the **Notebooks** page in Azure Machine Learning studio to run notebooks. 

1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), view the **Compute** page for your workspace; and on the **Compute Instances** tab, start your compute instance if it is not already running.
1. Select **Terminal** under **Applications** to open a terminal, and ensure that its **Compute** is set to your compute instance and that the current path is the **/users/your-user-name** folder.
1. Enter the following command to clone a Git repository containing notebooks, data, and other files to your workspace:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-dp100 mslearn-dp100
    ```
1. When the command has completed, in the **Notebooks** pane, click **&#8635;** to refresh the view and verify that a new **/users/*your-user-name*/mslearn-dp100** folder has been created. This folder contains multiple **.ipynb** notebook files.

> **Tip**: New to Python? Use the [Python cheat sheet](cheat-sheets/dp100-cheat-sheet-python.pdf) to understand the code.

## Monitor data drift for a dataset

In this exercise, the code to monitor data drift is provided in a notebook.

1. In the **Notebooks** page, browse to the **/users/*your-user-name*/mslearn-dp100** folder where you cloned the notebook repository, and open the **Monitor Data Drift** notebook.
2. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.

## Delete Azure resources

When you finish exploring Azure Machine Learning, you should delete the resources you've created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

1. Close the Azure Machine Learning Studio tab and return to the Azure portal.
1. In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
1. Select the **rg-dp100-labs** resource group.
1. At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**. 
1. Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.
